Use the new button to create a new grid. This grid will be added to a list of grids that you can switch between by changing the numberbox to the right. You will be asked for the width and height of your grid by dialog so make sure it isn't blocked!

Switch between Test mode and Edit mode using the combobox most to the right. In Test mode you can rotate squares by highlighting an area (click and drag) then clicking inside the highlighted area. Clicking outside this area will deselect the area (or using the button that appears). For your convienence, the valid move with the smallest turn will be applied. Use the square type combobox and colour selector then click on a square in Edit mode to modify the square.
